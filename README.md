# LyricScraper

 If there are multiple song names that are the same, you must include the artist

.EXE only works on windows

Fixed : Bug where sometimes instead of printing lyrics the youtube page is printed and if exe closes its due to an error in finding lyrics

EXE is in dist folder (scraper.exe, must extract before executing)
 
 This script uses azlyrics.com to scrape the lyrics from the user inputted song name and artist.
 
 There is an option to open the music video if desired.
 
 This code utilizes the google search module to look up the users input and get the url
 
 Beautifulsoup4 is used to make the html file readable after urllib requests the doc behind html
